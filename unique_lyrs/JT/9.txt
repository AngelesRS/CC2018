I was just walking that day aimlessly 
(Oh, oh no)
You picked a perfect day to bump into me Probably should've watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason we still met at your store 
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life and I listen well
Look, I'll be your confidant 
Tell me anything 
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings 

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between 
You're out of this world  Except you're not green 
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

All my friends meet you and say you're the one
And all my meaningless friendships should be done
You had a friend but he did you wrong 
But I'm a God sent sign that reads  Please move on with me
You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
And that's the way to His kingdom of eternal life Since you're an angel, baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 9-1-1

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between 
You're out of this world  Except you're not green 
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between 
You're out of this world  Except you're not green 
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

There's nothin' else in this world 
Like you
So why is it so complicated?
What are you afraid of?

I've been asking everybody what they think 
But I don't know why because they don't know you
I'm even asking other guys what would they say
But I don't know why 'cause they don't do what I do
Girl, I say an ultimatums for you
But you'd probably take that and just run
Now I gotta decide if I'mma help raise your mind Seems like the ultimatums or me that's no fun
