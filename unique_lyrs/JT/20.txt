Yeah come On

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl walkin' down the street 
Seen those bright brown eyes

With tears comin' down (so he said to himself)
She deserves a crown 
But where is it now Momma listen

[Chorus] Senorita I feel for you
You deal with things that you don't have to
He doesn't love you I can tell by his charm 
But you can feel this real love if you just lay in my

You drivin' fast in my mind
Girl don't cha slow it down
If we carry on this way the same we might leave the ground 
How would you like to fly

That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown 
Why hasn't it been found 

[Chorus]

Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms (Wont you lay in my)
Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms (Momma lay in my)
Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms (Baby wontcha lay in my)
Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms

When I look into your eyes
I see somethin' that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work harder for you girl 
and no longer will you ever have to
Cry!

[Chorus]

Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms
Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms
Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms
Ahhh, Ahhh, Arms

When I look into your eyes
I see somethin' that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work harder for you girl 
You won't ever cry
