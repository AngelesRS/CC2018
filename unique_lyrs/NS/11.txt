Oh huh, right now baby

Soon as the stars shine
I'm gonna make you mine, oh baby

You got it
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes 
You got it
I need it
Your love is what makes my heart break

Let me tell you how I feel
I need your lovin'
Girl give it to me Never met a girl like you
I know you'll like
The crazy things we'll do
 Walking slowly through the rain Without worries there's no pain
When you see a shooting star
All your problems seem so far
If you feel true love and trust 
Girl just give me all you got
'Cause girl you got the love I need

You got it
I want it
I'll do whatever it takes 
You got it
I need it
Your love is what makes my heart break

(You got it)
(You got it)

You are in my dreams at night  Whatever I do you're always on my mind
(I can't wait until the day)
(When you and me are one in love to stay)
 Walking slowly through the rain Without worries there's no pain
