Here it comes  Millennia 
And everybody's talkin' about  Jerusalem 
Is this the beginning 
Or beginning of the end?
Well I've got other thoughts my friends 
See, I've got my eyes on the skies 
The heavenly bodies of light 
And if you're in the mood to take a ride
Then strap on the suit and get inside 

[Chorus]
If you wanna fly
Come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly
Come and take a ride
Take a space ride with a cowboy, baby

We don't need all these prophecies Telling us what's inside  Cause paranoia ain't the way 
To live your life from day to day
So leave your doubts and your fears behind
Don't be afraid at all Cause up in outer space there's no gravity to fall
Put your mind and your body to the test Cause up in outer space is like a wild wild west
 
[Chorus]

[Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes] Sonic boom and never let you try to stop me
You wanna fly sky high up to the top see
No need to fear no doubts and no tears  Millennium sound will motivate the future years
And you've been hit to be scared 
Or get prepared against all odds
I'll bet you never would've dared 
To make these moves
And take flight like me
To come through for the world prophecy Space connect to overthrow your interception  Ready or not make it hot there ain't no question 
Or get in sync and put your head to the sky
Keep the faith one love from Left Eye

[Chorus: x2]
